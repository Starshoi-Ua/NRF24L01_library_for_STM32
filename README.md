That is a free to use NRF24l01 library that I wrote for myself. Posting it for everybody to use because I`m not niggard). It`s wrote with the use of HAL. It`s my first library writen ever, so pls don't be harsh.
To change settings edit NRF24_init(). For now you need to read some datasheet to do it. Maybe I will change it in future with some enums.
